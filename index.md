## Answers to prompts:

1. The most interesting thing that I have learned this quarter is about the neuroscience background of our project. It's interesting to see how different regions of the brain can be activated while a subject is performing different tasks, and that the images from these scans can be represented as vectors and then plotted. 

2. For our quarter 2 project, we are thinking about incorporating machine learning techniques into our analysis and develop a model where we classify the type of task that a subject is doing based on their current brain activity. 

3. For our quarter 1 project, we spent a lot of time exploring the data and understanding it and not enough time doing the statistical analysis. A change I would've made is cementing a solid plan beforehand so we have a more structured approach. 

4. The techniques we would be interested in our project include statistical analysis and machine learning techniques. We have been learning how to use techniques from the `Nilearn` library and I would like to continue using that as it has many methods for processing this specific type of data.
